            <h6>Created By: Luke Nathan, Terry Wang</h6>
            <br>
            <h6>Description:</h6>
            <p>Luke and Terry's fun club is a club for people who want to have fun. It says so in the name. This is a club that is very real
                and definitely not made up for the sake of having a club for this demo page. Anyways, have fun reading the same filler text 
                as the forum post about Terry not wanting to be late for assembly. I am now filling this card up with filler text. This 
                following paragraph is from D2: <br><br> When creating our plan, 
                we didn't realize the scope of what we were planning, resulting in it involving way more work than we were able to do, as most 
                of the features were removed. These removed features include forums, groups, multiple classes, and the implementation of Terry's 
                idea. This is unfortunate, though we wanted to have a good but small project instead of a bad but large project. We unfortunately 
                way overestimated our abilities, so overall the plan was not that successful, though we were able to complete a lot of it. 
                This next paragraph is also from D2 but it is the next section, target audience<br><br>
                Firstly, we were able to stay true to our target audience. While we did remove a lot of features from our website, the core 
                function of it stayed the same. This means that even though it is a very simple website, the target audience we are developing 
                it for is the same as it was when it was a bigger scope. Having our target audience in mind while developing the app really
                helped, as we were able to create a product more catered to our age than younger or older clients. Ultimately, our target
                audience was successful, as we didn't have to change it. This final paragraph is also from D2, GANTT Chart - Dates <br><br>
                When creating the GANTT chart, we included a full calendar system of when each task would be done and completed. Unfortunately,
                partly due to the removal of many tasks, we were unable to follow this system. Many of our inabilities to follow the times 
                however also come with scheduling errors in the actual GANTT chart. Firstly, we planned on completing C4 - Changes to 
                Plan, before we even started coding our website. This was common for most of the write-ups, as we didn't know how long 
                they would take, and how time consuming coding the website would be. Apart from scheduling errors, the other reason we 
                were unable to follow the times we set was because how time consuming each task was. For example, we spent over a month 
                on the messages and classes pages, so we were unable to stop working on those and move on to another task, While this means 
                that ultimately our time allocations of our GANTT chart were pretty unsuccessful, they still did help us keep somewhat on 
                track while working in class. Thanks, I would appreciate if you could answer this quickly. - Terry Wang
